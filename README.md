This project will be a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page which
will have links to a few recipes. The website will not be visually pleasing because it 
is the first site I have ever buillt.

In this project I will be practicing basic command line skills, a basic understanding of git and github, as well as an understanding of how to display text and images using HTML.
