    <h1>Chef John's Famous Falafel</h1>
    <p> Falafel is a delicious deep fried fritter of chickpeas, herbs, and spices that  
        originates from the Mediterranean,but just as commonly featured in the cuisine
        of the Middle East. Falafel is often served wrapped up in a warm pita bread, 
        made into a delicious sandwhich, or served on a plate with a side of tahini or 
        hummus! One of the advantages of falafel is that it makes for a delicious and 
        satisfying dish, that so happens to be vegetarian!
