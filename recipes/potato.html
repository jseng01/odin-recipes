    <h1>Creamy Leek and Potato Soup</h1>
    <p>There is nothing better on a cold or rainy day than a nice hot bowl of soup, and 
        there is no soup more filling than creamy leak and potato soup. This soup isn't your
        traditional french vichyssoie, which is a blended soup the color of cream. This 
        potato leak soup will be a little more rustic, but much more delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pounds Potatos</li>
        <li>4 Large Leeks</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>7 Cups Chicken or Vegetable Broth</li>
        <li>Chives for Garnish</li>
        <li>3 Sprigs of Thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>1 Cup Heavy Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot</li>
        <li>Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and
             wilted, about 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, broth, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes
